# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Some key features include:

Readability: Python code is easy to read and understand, making it accessible for beginners and experienced developers alike.
Versatility: Python can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
Large Standard Library: Python comes with a vast collection of libraries and modules for various tasks.
Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.
Python is popular in web development (Django, Flask), data science (Pandas, NumPy), and automation (scripting).

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
To install Python:

Windows: Download Python installer from python.org, run it, and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
macOS: Use the installer from python.org or install via Homebrew (brew install python).
Linux: Use the package manager (apt, yum, etc.) to install Python.
Verify installation with python --version. Set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate   # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
Python Syntax and Semantics:

python
Copy code
# Simple Hello, World! program
print("Hello, World!")
Syntax elements: print is a built-in function to output text. "Hello, World!" is a string enclosed in double quotes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
Data Types and Variables:

Basic data types: int, float, bool, str, list, tuple, dict.

python
Copy code
# Example script demonstrating variables and data types
num = 10
pi = 3.14
is_python_fun = True
name = "Alice"
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

print(num, pi, is_python_fun, name)
print(my_list)
print(my_dict)

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
Control Structures:

Conditional statement (if-else):

python
Copy code
# Example of if-else statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
Loop (for loop):

python
Copy code
# Example of a for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    
6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
Functions in Python:

Functions are blocks of reusable code. Example:

python
Copy code
# Example of a function
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print("Sum:", result)
Functions help in organizing code, promoting reuse, and enhancing readability.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
 Lists and Dictionaries:

Lists are ordered collections, dictionaries are key-value pairs.

python
Copy code
# Example of lists and dictionaries
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'cherry': 8}

print("List:", my_list)
print("Dictionary:", my_dict)

# Accessing elements
print("First element of list:", my_list[0])
print("Value of 'banana' in dictionary:", my_dict['banana'])

# Adding elements
my_list.append(6)
my_dict['orange'] = 7

# Iterating through elements
for item in my_list:
    print(item)

for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, "->", value)
    
8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
Exception Handling:

Exception handling manages errors gracefully.

python
Copy code
# Example of try-except-finally block
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")
finally:
    print("Execution complete")


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
Modules and Packages:

Modules are Python files, packages are directories of modules.

python
Copy code
# Example of using the math module
import math

print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))
print("Value of pi:", math.pi)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
File I/O:

Reading from a file:

python
Copy code
# Example of reading from a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:

python
Copy code
# Example of writing to a file
data = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for item in data:
        file.write(item + '\n')
        
# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
